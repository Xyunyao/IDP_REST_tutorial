# Structure file and topology file

C-terminal $\alpha$-synuclein protein structure file which will be used to generate solvated structure files for equilibration.


* `prot_only.pdb` : Structure file for C-terminal $\alpha$-synuclein containing 20 amino acids.
* `processed.top` : Topology file for C-terminal $\alpha$-synuclein. It do not have any ions or solvent molecules.
