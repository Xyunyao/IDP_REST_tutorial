# Structure file and topology files

There are 3 files provided here. They are :

* `prot_only.pdb` : Structure file for 20 amino acids C-terminal segment of $\alpha$-synuclein containing. If you open the file, it looks somehwhat like this :
    ```bash
    REMARK    GENERATED BY TRJCONV

    ```

    Line with `CRYST1` records the box vectors in which the protein is located. Section starting with `ATOM` records the atoms of the protein and there information. The first 3 floating point numbers are the _x_, _y_ and _z_ co-ordinates of respective atoms. This will be used to generate the topology file (topol.top) used by gromacs during simulations. 
<br />

* `topol.top` : Topology file for C-terminal $\alpha$-synuclein generated from `pdb2gmx`. It do not have any ions or solvent molecules which can be viewed at `[molecules]` of the file :

    ```bash
    [ molecules ]
    ; Compound        #mols
    Protein_chain_A     1
    ```

    It gets the atom, bond and other information from the force field files which we can see form this lines:

    ```bash
    ; Include forcefield parameters
    #include "./a99SBdisp.ff/forcefield.itp"

    ; Include water topology
    #include "./a99SBdisp.ff/tip4pd.itp"

    ; Include topology for ions
    #include "./a99SBdisp.ff/ions.itp"
    ```
    The parameters required to properly define the protein is present in different sections such as `[ atoms ]`, `[ bonds ]`, `[ pairs ]`, `[ angles ]` and `[ dihedrals ]`. For example the following section of the file maps and sets the atom types, charge and mass for each particle of respective protein atoms:

    ```bash
    [ atoms ]
    ;   nr       type  resnr residue  atom   cgnr     charge       mass  typeB    chargeB      massB
    ; residue 121 NASP rtp NASP q  0.0
        1         N3    121   NASP      N      1     0.0782      14.01
        2          H    121   NASP     H1      2       0.22      1.008
        3          H    121   NASP     H2      3       0.22      1.008
        4          H    121   NASP     H3      4       0.22      1.008
        5         CT    121   NASP     CA      5     0.0292      12.01
        6         HP    121   NASP     HA      6     0.1141      1.008
        7         CT    121   NASP     CB      7    -0.0235      12.01
        8         HC    121   NASP    HB1      8    -0.0169      1.008
        9         HC    121   NASP    HB2      9    -0.0169      1.008
        10         C6    121   NASP     CG     10     0.8194      12.01
    ```

    Similarly bonds are mapped as : 

    ```bash
    [ bonds ]
    ;  ai    aj funct            c0            c1            c2            c3
        1     2     1   
        1     3     1
        1     4     1
        1     5     1  
        5     6     1
    ```
    Where the first two numbers represent the atom numbers and the function number 1 tells how to perceive/interpret the bond between the atoms.       
<br />

* `processed.top` : Topology file for C-terminal $\alpha$-synuclein containing all the information required to simulate the protein. It do not have any ions or solvent molecules. This can be generated using `gmx grompp -pp`. As you can see it is independent of `#include` definition as all that information is now included in the topology file. For example you will see `[ atomtypes ]` in the current file which is generally present in `./a99SBdisp.ff/forcefield.itp`.

    ```bash
    [ defaults ]
    ; nbfunc        comb-rule       gen-pairs       fudgeLJ fudgeQQ
    1               2               yes             0.5     0.8333
